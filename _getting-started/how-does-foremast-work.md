## How Does Foremast Work?

Foremast leverages multiple components that work in harmony in order to ascertain, alert on and maintain application health. The key components are:

- Barrelman: Watch for deployment events, and trigger application actions
- Brain: Machine learning on application health metrics and triggering of anomalies
- UI: Visually show the current state of applications, expected state and any remediations performed

The [design and architecture](https://github.intuit.com/dev-containers/foremast/blob/master/docs/design.md) captures the interaction between these components in greater detail.
