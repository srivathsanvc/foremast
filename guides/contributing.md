### How to become a contributor and submit your own code

#### Contributor License Agreements <a id="contributor-license-agreements"></a>

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement \(CLA\).

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual CLA.
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA.

To sign and submit a CLA, see the [CLA doc](https://git.k8s.io/community/CLA.md).

2. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
3. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement \(see details above\).
4. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
5. Submit a pull request.
